                <p>As a New York City resident, and a Mechanical Engineering and Electronic Media, Arts, and Communication dual major at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), I receive a lot of the typical questions. I get asked, “What’s it like living in such crowded streets? Do you have to take the taxi all the time? Does this train go to Grand Central?” However, the most frequent question is, “why are you studying engineering and art? What do you even do with that degree?” Unlike most degrees, my degree isn’t about what I want to be, but rather who I want to be. It began when I was a kid, my name is Andy Lao and this is my story.
                <h2>My Background</h2>
                <p>Following the footsteps of my older sister, I started competitive swimming at a very young age. It was my form of exercise, social networking, and entertainment. I was doing well in school and I felt swimming was the one thing keeping me challenged and one of my few outlets for progress. Honestly, I was comfortable, I had a lot of friends, and a loving family. That all changed in an instant. On March 17th, 2006, I was in a car on the way to a swim meet with my mom, sister, best friend Douglas, his brother Kevin, and their mom Mrs. Kwan. Things went black that morning and I woke three days later in a hospital. I learned that day that only my mom had survived the crash.</p>
                <p>As a ten year old, this was a lot to handle. I was struck with survivor’s guilt and I was not sure what to do with myself. I was stuck in the past. Thankfully, I attended De La Salle Academy for middle school and met what have turned out to be lifelong friends. They helped me heal and find my way back. During those years of recovery, I was Dante and my friends, family, and teachers were my Vergil. They taught me to open up and allow others to help. Things appear daunting and scary when you’re alone, but when you’re surrounded with people who want to help, letting them in will help. I discovered that I had a lot to look forward to, and many different outlets for progress. Engineering and art became my new outlets. I was finally happy again.</p>
                <h2>My Goals</h2>
                <p>Being challenged and having room to progress brings great joy, but having the opportunity to support and feel supported further amplifies that feeling. This made teamwork second nature to me. I believe my course of study and my varied skillset place me in a position to participate effectively in a team; to collaborate and communicate with my teammates in a more versatile manner. By studying both engineering and art, I am empowered with both technical and creative perspectives that permit me to be supportive and helpful, in addition to allowing myself to be placed in a challenging environment where I can seek help and ultimately progress as an individual – everything I could ask for.</p>
                <p>As John Lasseter says, “the art challenges technology, and the technology inspires the art.” Having experience in engineering and art allows me to be on either ends of this beautiful cycle and will continue to challenge me, and give me and the world room to improve. Studying engineering and art is not about chasing the dream job – it’s the pursuit of happiness.</p>
                <h2>Spare Time</h2>
                <p>In my spare time, you can find me exploring new art techniques, reading a book, playing games, dancing, or exploring new food places.</p>
