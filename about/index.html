                <p>My name is Andy Lao. I am currently an Electronic Media, Arts, and Communication and Mechanical Engineering dual major at Rensselaer Polytechnic
                  Institute (it’s a mouthful, I know.) I receive a lot of questions as to why I chose this course of study and to be completely honest, it just sort
                  of happened. I entered college as an engineer and two years into engineering I discovered my love for art and design. Art would become my passion and
                  engineering would become a source of knowledge and an additional outlet to apply my creativity to. By adding an art degree my coursework would get exponentially
                  harder, I’d have less time to spend with friends, and ultimately I would have to stay in school an extra year to finish both curriculums. The choice
                  was clear - I had to this. </p>
                <p>I didn’t grow up drawing every day, and I wasn’t the student that was the “kid that could draw.” In fact, I was quite the opposite. I was the kid who
                  was “good at math and science”, the “swimmer.” In 2006, my family was caught in a tragic car accident that resulted in the death of my best friend, his
                  mother, his brother, and my older sister. I survived with many broken bones. For years I was struck with survivor’s guilt - I was in this abyss and didn’t
                  let anyone in. It wasn’t until I started opening up and making friends again that I discovered I had so much more to look forward to in life. I wanted to
                  find that happiness.</p>
                <p>I found that happiness in art and in sharing my craft with others. In high school I discovered dance and since then I haven’t stopped. In college I discovered
                  drawing and painting and the moment I started studying design, it was clear to me – I was happy. I knew that I had to go down this road, no matter how tough
                  it was for my own well-being, and to really live to the fullest for those that didn’t get the chance to. It’s my pursuit of happiness.</p>

                      <p>My Art</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>I've always loved reading "Art of" books, and looking at all the promotional and concept work. I also grew up playing a lot of different fantasy role playing
                    games and watching cartoons with my sister and uncle. A lot of my work is inspired by these books, games, and television shows that I have read and watched. However,
                    I also love experimenting and trying new things. I am always ready to learn more and continue to grow as an artist. I post a lot of my works such as
                    vector graphics, portraits, sketches, and experimental pieces on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/andylao.art/" target="_blank"><font color = "red">Facebook</font></a>

                    , and <a href="http://ikuppo.deviantart.com/" target="_blank"><font color = "red">Deviant Art</font></a>. All in all, if it's art, if it's design, chances are, I'm going to enjoy
                    every bit of it.</p>

                </div>
                <p>As John Lasseter said, “the art challenges technology, and the technology inspires the art.” To be able to experience this cycle fully would be a
                  dream come true. I just want to dive deeper into my passion and to keep going.</p>

                    <p>Spare Time</p>
                </div>
                <p>When I’m not being overly reflective or drawing I like to watch movies, read books, dance, and try new foods. I also like to travel to new places and
                  take as many photos as humanly possible. Other than that, I’m always down for a nice cup of coffee (milk, no sugar) or green tea. </p>
