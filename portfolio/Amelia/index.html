                    <h2>About Amelia</h2>
                    <p>Raised under the Dark Emperor, Amelia was trained to become one of the greatest swordsmen in the continent. Gifted with the ability to summon two
                      massive blades and wield them effortlessly, she was an important asset to the emperor’s evil plans. When she turned 18, the Dark Emperor ordered
                       Amelia to travel to the Temple of Light and to raze it down. She accepted the mission with pleasure and readied her armor. Amelia traveled for
                       several days and finally arrived at the temple. She walked in ready to wreak havoc but as she walked in, a couple
                       came running to her and gave her a hug. She didn’t understand but the warmth and the feeling was familiar. The couple looked up to Amelia with tears in their eyes and said,
                        “You’re finally home Amy.” Still confused, she distanced herself from the couple and with a flash of red light, summoned her blades. She was shaking, unsure of what was happening.
                        She had a feeling that what she was doing wasn’t right but she had a mission to fulfill. The couple looked at one another and smiled, and with a similar flash of red summoned their
                        blades. Amelia dropped down to her knees in tears. In the hands of the couple were identical blades. The couple withdrew their weapons and went to comfort Amelia. With smiles on
                        their faces, they said, “Welcome home.” Amelia found her parents that were said to have been killed by the Dark Emperor. She couldn’t complete her mission, but she couldn’t stay.
                        When Amelia returned to the Dark Emperor prepared to face him. However, she could not defeat him. Amelia was stripped of her armor, tortured, and locked up. When she heard that the emperor
                        was going to finish the mission himself, she couldn’t sit still. She waited until dark, broke out of her chains, took what she could salvage of her armor and set out to stop the army
                        before they arrived at the Temple of Light, her home.</p>
