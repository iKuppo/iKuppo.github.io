                    <h2>About Rene</h2>
                    <p>Raised in a small village in the mountains, Rene was raised as a warrior alongside her twin brother, August.
                      Their village was plagued by constant attacks from outside forces and had to fight to defend it. Rene and August
                      were both well known for their skill in combat. Rene’s signature scythe would be seen cutting through monsters from
                      a distance, leaving behind a pink trail of pedals with each swing. One day, the village was attacked by the Dark Empire.
                      Many were killed or injured. August, was taken into captivity. Wounded, Rene could not stop the Empire from taking him away.
                      When she regained consciousness, she wanted to go save August but was stopped by one of the village elders. The elder cautioned
                      Rene that she was no match for the Empire and would only get killed trying to save August. It was too risky and they didn’t even
                      know if he was still alive. Rene would not believe August would go down so easily, but the elder was right. Rene stayed in the village,
                      helped repair it, and trained to get stronger for the day she has a chance to rescue August. One morning, two years after the incident,
                      the bells were heard ringing, signaling everyone that the Dark Army was approaching. Rene went to her armor, prepared her scythe for battle.
                      Little did she know that August was the one leading the army….</p>
